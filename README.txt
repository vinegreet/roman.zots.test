In this project I use setup that creates virtual server for development.

After I change and save files, page in browser refreshes. After I change and save Sass file, it compiles into CSS file and page in the browser refreshes too.

Workflow:

1. Download and install Node.js, NPM and Git
2. Clone my repository, prepared in advance
3. Run 'npm install' command in Bash - it installs all the dependencies, stated in package.json
4. Run 'npm run gulp' command in Bash - it starts the server and opens a new tab in the browser
5. Work on the code of HTML, Sass and JS files

==================================================

How to use (Node.js and NPM have to be installed):

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to 'roman.zots.test' folder
3. Run 'npm install'
4. When finished, run 'npm run gulp mission#', where '#' is the number of mission. For example, to see solution of 3rd mission, run 'npm run gulp mission3'.
